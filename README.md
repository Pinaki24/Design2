# Welcome to the Design 2 Drone Project by Team 02! ðŸ˜Š

This repository contains the source code for implementing key drone functionalities, including:

- **Line Detection**
- **Autonomous Takeoff**
- **Hovering**
- **Landing**


## Features

- **Line Detection**: Detects and follows lines using the ESP32 CAM with MAVLink integration.
- **Autonomous Takeoff**: Enables the drone to take off automatically without manual intervention.
- **Hovering**: Utilizes an optical flow sensor for stable and controlled hovering.
- **Landing**: Automated landing sequence initiated after hovering.

## Technology Stack

- **DroneKit** for flight control
- **MAVLink** for communication with the flight controller
- **ESP32 CAM** for vision-based line detection
- **Optical Flow Sensor** for hover stability
- **PI Control** for motor efficiency
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance
