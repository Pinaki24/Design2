# Design2

Welcome to the Design 2 Drone project by Team02! This repository contains the source code used to implement key functionalities such as line detection, autonomous takeoff, hovering, and landing. The project also incorporates PI control for efficient motor management.

# Features:  
Line Detection: Uses camera inputs to detect lines for navigation.  
PI Control: Provides smooth and efficient motor control during flight.  
Autonomous Hovering & Landing: Includes automated takeoff, hovering, and landing routines with obstacle avoidance.  
# Key Files:  
Line_detection.py: Line detection using camera inputs.  
PI.py: Proportional-Integral controller for motor control.  
takeoff_hover_avoid_land.py: Code for autonomous flight, including obstacle avoidance.
