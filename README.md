Design2 Drone Project
This repository contains the source code for the Design 2 Drone project. The drone implements key functionalities such as line detection, autonomous takeoff, hovering, and landing, using PI control for motor management.

Features:
Line Detection: Uses camera inputs to detect lines for navigation.
PI Control: Ensures smooth and efficient motor control during flight.
Autonomous Hovering & Landing: Automated flight routines, including takeoff, hover, and landing, with obstacle avoidance.

Key Files:

Line_detection.py – Line detection via camera.
PI.py – Proportional-Integral controller implementation.
takeoff_hover_avoid_land.py – Autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance.
